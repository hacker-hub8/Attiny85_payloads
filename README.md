## digispark Attiny 85 payloads and scripts

**About:** 

The Digispark Attiny85 is a small microcontroller often used for various electronics projects, including HID (Human Interface Device) attacks. It can emulate a USB keyboard or mouse, allowing it to execute preprogrammed scripts or payloads when plugged into a target device. Common payloads include automating keystrokes to open command prompts, downloading malicious files, or exfiltrating data. Scripts are written in Arduino IDE using libraries like DigiKeyboard.h. While it has legitimate uses in automation and prototyping, its compact size and ease of programming have also made it a tool in penetration testing and ethical hacking. Always ensure responsible and authorized use!
